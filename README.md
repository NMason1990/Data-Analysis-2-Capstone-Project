## Project Description

[1. I will be taking Data in from the fabdb.net API, from the cards endpoint
Then scraping data from TCGPlayer.net that will show more cards, current market price and potentially other insights to make this data wider.

2. I will be mnerging my data with pandas merge, manipulating and removing any empty values, finding a way to fix the duplicate entries from the two data sets, and filtering to only show columns that I need for my end goals

3. Depending on time available i will be doing either this -  Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data
Intermediate or this - Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot. Pivot tables are a way to summarize your data and present it easily in a way that isnâ€™t just a graph.
They can be useful when combined with graphs.
Intermediate

4. I will use a virtual env or most likely a anaconda environment for this project, also asking my mentor for any other best practices or ways to make it look cleaner and more readable

5. I will be using a Jupyter notebook for annotation and to inerpret the data  ]
